# patatap-clone
This is a simplified version of the online application Patatap[1] created by me. 

This application makes use of the Paper.js library for animations. Most of the functionality for this application is written in PaperScript which is a modified version of JavaScript used with Paper.js. 
All the associated sounds are added using the Howler.js library. 

Rest of the application is written using HTML and CSS. 


[1] Patatap was created by Jono Brandel in 2012.
